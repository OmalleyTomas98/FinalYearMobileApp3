\subsection{Graphical User Interface}
\begin{enumerate}
 
  
	\item Splash Screen
   \begin{itemize}
     \item Splash screens are typically used by particularly large applications to notify the user that the program is in the process of loading. They provide feedback that a lengthy process is underway. Occasionally, a progress bar within the splash screen indicates the loading progress. A splash screen disappears when the application's main window appears. Splash screens may be added for a period of time and then replaced anew.The Splash screen displays the developers name and the 
     studio icon.
