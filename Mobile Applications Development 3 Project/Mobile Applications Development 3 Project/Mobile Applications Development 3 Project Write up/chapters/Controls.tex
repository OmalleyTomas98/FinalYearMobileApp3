\subsection{WASD Control  Mechanismn   }


  The Player will control their movement through the use of the WASD keys. I found this is the 
    mostcommon movement keyset from research online and from my experience of Computer gaming.I found 
    this is the movement keyset for right handed People.WASD was also a standard used in the 1970s for video 
    games like wizardy and allowed for the number pad to be free for additional controls.I decided that the fire
    action will be mapped to the space bar as it is too the most common approach . Controls for the Player Object are as follows 
    W-Jump , A-Left , S-Duck , D-Right , Spacebar-Fire bullet and P to pause the game session.

\begin{enumerate}
 
  
	\item Button Combinations 
   \begin{itemize}
     \item (W) - When the W key is triggered the player will jump upwards and play a short animation
     \item (A) - When the A key is triggered the player will move left and a short animation will play to immerse the player
     \item (S) - When the S key is triggered the player will duck downwards and a short animatiopn will play 
     \item (D) - When the D key is triggered the player will 
     \item (SPACEBAR) - When the space bar is triggered the fire button will be triggered and a bullet object will be shot 
     \item (P) - When the P key is triggered the game will come to a hault and the player will be prompted with a puase menu
